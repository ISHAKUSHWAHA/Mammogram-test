    "BI-RADS is an assesment of how confident the severity classification is; it is not a \"predictive\" attribute and so I will discard it. The age, shape, margin, and density attributes are the features that we will build our model with, and \"severity\" is the classification we will attempt to predict based on those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
